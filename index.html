<h1>Siyu Wang, Ph.D.</h1>
</div>

<p> I am Siyu Wang and I'm now a 2L (second year) JD student at <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis School of Law</a>. I'm interested in practicing patent law in the future. For the past (2022) summer, I interned at Zhong Law LLC, a boutique patent law firm, as a summer associate under the supervision of two senior patent attorneys, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuang-zhao-2aa57a10a/">Shuang Zhao, Esq.</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jialin-zhong-b458565/">Jialin Zhong, Esq., PhD</a>. For the upcoming (2023) summer, I will join the patent prosecution group at <a href="https://www.sheppardmullin.com/">Sheppard Mullin</a> (Del Mar office).  
  
<p> Before joining law school, I obtained my PhD degree from <a href="https://genome.duke.edu/education/cbb">the Program of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Duke University</a> in spring 2021. I was also affiliated to <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/">the Department of Computer Science at Duke University</a>. My thesis advisor was <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/">Prof. Bruce R. Donald</a>, who is a James B. Duke professor</a> of Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry and Biochemistry at Duke University, and also an ACM fellow and IEEE fellow. <a href="https://www.jflap.org/donaldlab/home.php">Prof. Donald's lab</a> is dedicated to developing <a href="https://www.jflap.org/donaldlab/software.php">computational protein design algorithm and software</a>, and applying them to real biological systems. When I was there I specifically worked on a few human health related projects, including designing novel therapeutics to cystic fibrosis, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). </p>

<p> I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm">Tsinghua University</a> in China in 2015, majored in control and electrical engineering. When I was there, I worked closely with <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zengjy/">Prof. Jianyang Zeng</a>, who is an associate professor at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University. We worked together on developing novel computational method to model the 3D structure of chromatin, using chromosome conformation capture (3C) data and Hi-C data. </p>

<p> In my leisure time I like to play video games. I am a huge fan of <a href="https://blog.dota2.com/">Dota 2</a>.
